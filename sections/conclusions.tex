\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have developed a domain-specific language for declarative interactive workflows.
We have identified, what we believe to be, the essence of Task-Oriented Programming, and provided corresponding operators in our language.
We have compared our language with \CSP to point out differences and similarities.
Finally, we have proven type safety for our language.
