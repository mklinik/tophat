\section{Example}

In this section we develop a small example program.
The example demonstrates that \tophat, which is a subset of TOP, has sufficient expressive power to model a useful application.

The example is a flight booking system.
It demonstrates communication with the environment, communication between parallel tasks, and synchronization and input validation via guarded steps.

The application should fulfil the following requirements.
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple users should be able to book tickets at the same time.
\item A user first has to input a list of passengers for which to book tickets.
\item At least one of the passengers has to be an adult.
\item After a valid list of passengers has been input, the user has to pick a seat for each passenger.
\item Only free seats may be picked.
\item Every passenger must have exactly one seat.
\end{itemize}
