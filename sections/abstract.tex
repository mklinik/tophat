The concept of Task-Oriented Programming (TOP) allows declarative specification of interactive multi-user applications.
iTasks is an implementation of TOP, focussing on ease of use and feature completeness.
In this paper we decompose the rich combinators of iTasks into atomic language features, suitable for formal treatment.
We develop a process algebra-like calculus, show how it relates to iTasks, and compare it to classical works in the field.
