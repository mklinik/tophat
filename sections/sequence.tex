In the previous section we have set up our interaction model of actions,
and we defined our first interactive component, the editor.
Now we can continue with the composition of tasks.
By composing tasks we
Composing tasks can be done in two ways:
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item sequential; or
  \item parallel.
\end{enumerate*}
For parallel composition we distinguish two kinds:
\begin{enumerate*}[(a)]
  \item pairing two tasks (\emph{and}-parallel); and
  \item choosing between two tasks (\emph{or}-parallel).
\end{enumerate*}
In this section we start with sequential composition.
The next two sections are about pairing and choosing.
