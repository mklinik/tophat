\section{Comparison}

In this section we compare TOP with Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP).
We chose CSP as an example to stand for the numerous process algebras in existence, which, as far as this section is concerned, are reasonably similar.
Notions like communication with the environment and between subsystems, concurrency, and sequential composition can be found in both TOP and in process algebras.
This raises the question of how the languages relate.

We provide comparisons based on three aspects.
First, we compare the scope of the languages, as intended by the authors.
Second, we show how similar features like concurrency and stepping work.
Third, we provide some example problems and illustrate how they can be solved in each language.
