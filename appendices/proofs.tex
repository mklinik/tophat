\subsection{\cref{thm:pres-eval}}

\begin{proof}
  We prove \cref{thm:pres-eval} by induction on $e$:

  \case
    {$e=\lambda x:\tau.e, e_1 e_2, x, c, l, e_1 \star e_2,\If{e_1}{e_2}{e_3},\tuple{e_1, e_2},\unit,\Ref e,!e,e_1 := e_2$}
    {Preservation has been proven for these cases by Pierce~\cite{books/Pierce02TAPL}.}

  \case
    {$\userule{E-Edit}$}
    {Given that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers\Edit e:\Task \tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s$,\refrule{T-Edit} gives us that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e:\tau$.
    The induction hypothesis gives us that $e,s\evaluate v,s'$ also preserves, and thus $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers v:\tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s'$.
    Therefore $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers\Edit v:\Task\tau$.}

  \case
    {$\userule{E-Enter}$}
    {Evaluation does not alter $e$ and $s$, therefore this case holds trivially.}

  \case
    {$\userule{E-Update}$}
    {Given that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers \Edit e:\Task \tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s$, \refrule{T-Update} gives us that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e:\Ref \tau$.
    The induction hypothesis gives us that $e,s\evaluate l,s'$ also preserves, and thus $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers l:\Ref\tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s'$.
    Therefore $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers\Update l:\Task\tau$.}

  \case
    {$\userule{E-Fail}$}
    {Evaluation does not alter $e$ and $s$, therefore this case holds trivially.}

  \case
    {$\userule{E-Then}$}
    {Given that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_1\Then e_2:\Task \tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s$, \refrule{T-Then} gives us that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_1:\Task\tau_1$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_2:\tau_1 \to \Task \tau$.
    By the induction hypothesis, we know that $e_1,s\evaluate t_1,s'$ preserves and thus $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1:\Task\tau_1$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s'$.
    Therefore $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1\Then e_2:\Task\tau$.}

  \case
    {$\userule{E-Next}$}
    {Given that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_1\Next e_2:\Task \tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s$, \refrule{T-Next} gives us that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_1:\Task\tau_1$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_2:\tau_1 \to \Task \tau$.
    By the induction hypothesis, we know that $e_1,s\evaluate t_1,s'$ preserves and thus $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1:\Task\tau_1$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s'$.
    Therefore $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1\Next e_2:\Task\tau$.}

  \case
    {$\userule{E-And}$}
    {Given that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_1\And e_2:\Task(\tau_1\times\tau_2)$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s$, \refrule{T-And} gives us that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_1:\Task\tau_1$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_2:\Task\tau_2$.
    By the induction hypothesis, we know that both $e_1,s\evaluate t_1,s'$ and $e_2,s'\evaluate t_2,s''$ preserve and thus $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1:\Task\tau_1$, $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s'$, $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_2:\Task\tau_2$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s''$.
    Therefore $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1\And t_2:\Task(\tau_1\times\tau_2)$.}

  \case
    {$\userule{E-Or}$}
    {Given that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_1\Or e_2:\Task\tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s$, \refrule{T-Or} gives us that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_1:\Task\tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_2:\Task\tau$.
    By the induction hypothesis, we have that both $e_1,s\evaluate t_1,s'$ and $e_2,s'\evaluate t_2,s''$ preserve and thus $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1:\Task\tau$, $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s'$, $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_2:\Task\tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s''$.
    Therefore $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1\Or t_2:\Task\tau$.}

  \case
    {$\userule{E-Xor}$}
    {Evaluation does not alter $e$ and $s$, therefore this case holds trivially.}

  % \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{E-Appoint}$
  %     Given that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers u \At e:\Task\tau$ and $\Sigma\infers s$, the induction hypothesis gives us that $e,s\evaluate t,s'$ also preserves, and therefore by \refrule{T-Appoint} $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers u \At t:\Task\tau$.
\end{proof}



\subsection{\cref{lem:presvalue}}

\begin{lemma}[Task value preserves types]
  % For all well typed expressions $e$ and states $\sigma$,
  For all expressions $e$ and states $\sigma$
  such that $\Gamma,\Sigma \infers e:\Task\tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma \infers \sigma$,
  if $\Value{(e,\sigma)}=v$,
  then $v:\tau$.
  \label{lem:presvalue}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We prove \cref{lem:presvalue} by induction over $e$.

\case {$\Value{(\Edit v,s)}=v$}
      {By T-Edit, if $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers \Edit v:\Task\tau$, then $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers v:\tau$.}

\case {$\Value{(\Enter \tau,s)}=\bot$ }
      {Since this case does not lead to a value, the lemma holds trivially.}

\case {$\Value{(\Update l,s)}=s(l)$ }
      {Given that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers\Update l:\Task \tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s$,

      {Since this case does not lead to a value, the lemma holds trivially.}

\case {$\Value{(t_1\And t_2,s)}=\tuple{v_1, v_2}$ given that $\Value{(t_1,s)}=v_1\wedge\Value{(t_2,s)}=v_2$}
      {By \refrule{T-And} we have that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1\And t_2:\Task(\tau_1\times\tau_2)$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1:\tau_1$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_2:\tau_2$.
      By the induction hypothesis, $ \Value{(t_1,s)}=v_1$ and $\Value{(t_2,s)}=v_2$ preserve, and thus $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers v_1:\tau_1$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers v_2:\tau_2$.
      This gives us that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers \tuple{v_1, v_2}:\Task(\tau_1\times\tau_2)$.}

      { Since this case does not lead to a value, the lemma holds trivially.}

\case
{$\Value{(t_1\Or t_2,s)}=\bot$ given that
  $\Value{(t_1,s)}=\bot\wedge\Value{(t_2,s)}=\bot$}{ Since this case does not

\case{$\Value{(t_1\Xor t_2,s)}=\bot$ }{Since this case does not

  % \noindent\textbf{Case} $\Value{(u\At t,s)}=\Value(t,s)$ This case follows
  % directly from the induction hypothesis.

\subsection{\cref{thm:pres-stride}}

\begin{lemma}[Striding preserves types]
  For all expressions $e$ and states $\sigma$
  such that $\Gamma,\Sigma \infers e:\Task\tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma \infers \sigma$,
  if $e,\sigma \stride e',\sigma'$,
  then $\Gamma,\Sigma \infers e':\Task\tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma \infers \sigma'$.
  \label{thm:pres-stride}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We prove \cref{thm:pres-stride} by induction on $e$:

     By the induction hypothesis, we also have $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1':\tau_1$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_2':\tau_2$.
     This gives us that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1'\And t_2':\Task(\tau_1\times\tau_2)$.}

       {Given that
  $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_1\Next e_2:\Task \tau$, \refrule{T-Then} gives us that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1:\Task\tau_1$ and
  $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers e_2:\tau_1 \to \Task \tau$. By the induction hypothesis,
  we know that $t_1\stride t_1'$ preserves and thus
  $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1':\Task\tau_1$. Therefore
  $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1'\Next e_2:\Task\tau$.}

  \case{$\userule{S-ThenCont}$}
  {Given that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1\Then e_2:\Task\tau$, by \refrule{T-Then} we have
  $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t_1:\Task\tau_1$ and

\subsection{\Cref{thm:pres-norm}}

\begin{proof}
  We prove \cref{thm:pres-norm} by induction on $e$:

    \Cref{thm:pres-eval}.
    Then by \cref{thm:pres-stride}, we have $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers t':\Task\tau$ and $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers s''$.}

\subsection{\cref{thm:pres-handle}}



We require the following Lemma for this proof.

\begin{lemma}

This lemma follows immediately from definition.

\begin{proof}

%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-ThenStay}$\\
%   and $\userule{S-ThenFail}$ The \refrule{E-Then} rule gives us that evaluation
%   has been applied to $t_1$. We therefore can apply the induction hypothesis,
%   from which we obtain that $t_1',s'\evaluate t_1'',s''$ then $t_1'=t_1''$ and
%   $s'=s''$. This, together with the \refrule{E-Then} rule, proves this case.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-ThenCont}$ By application of the induction
%   hypothesis, we obtain that $t_2',s'''\evaluate t_2'',s''''$ then $t_2'=t_2''$
%   and $s'''=s''''$, which immediately proves this case.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-OrLeft}$ The \refrule{E-Or} rule gives us
%   that evaluation has been applied to $t_1$. We therefore can apply the
%   induction hypothesis, from which we obtain that $t_1',s'\evaluate t_1'',s''$
%   then $t_1'=t_1''$ and $s'=s''$, which immediately proves this case.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-OrRight}$The \refrule{E-Or} rule gives us
%   that evaluation has been applied to $t_2$. We therefore can apply the
%   induction hypothesis, from which we obtain that $t_2',s'\evaluate t_2'',s''$
%   then $t_2'=t_2''$ and $s'=s''$, which immediately proves this case.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-OrNone}$ The \refrule{E-Or} rule gives us
%   that evaluation has been applied to both $t_1$ and $t_1$. We assumed that the
%   states do not change, so we know that $s=s'=s''$. We can therefore safely
%   apply the induction hypothesis twice, to obtain that
%   $t_1',s''\evaluate t_1'',s'''$ then $t_1'=t_1''$ and $s''=s'''$, and
%   $t_2',s'''\evaluate t_2'',s''''$ then $t_2'=t_2''$ and $s'''=s''''$. This,
%   together with the \refrule{E-Or} rule proves this case.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-Edit}$ by definiton, $\Edit v$ is a value
%   with respect to evaluation.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-Fill}$ by definition, $\Enter \tau$ is a
%   value with respect to evaluation.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-Update}$ by definiton, $\Update l$ is a
%   value with respect to evaluation.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-Fail}$ by definiton, $\Fail$ is a value
%   with respect to evaluation.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-Xor}$ by definition, $e_1\Xor e_2$ is a
%   value with respect to evaluation.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-Next}$ The \refrule{E-Next} rule gives us
%   that evaluation has been applied to $t_1$. We therefore can apply the
%   induction hypothesis, from which we obtain that $t_1',s'\evaluate t_1'',s''$
%   then $t_1'=t_1''$ and $s'=s''$. This, together with the \refrule{E-Next} rule,
%   proves this case.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-And}$ The \refrule{E-And} rule gives us
%   that evaluation has been applied to both $t_1$ and $t_1$. We assumed that the
%   states do not change, so we know that $s=s'=s''$. We can therefore safely
%   apply the induction hypothesis twice, to obtain that
%   $t_1',s''\evaluate t_1'',s'''$ then $t_1'=t_1''$ and $s''=s'''$, and
%   $t_2',s'''\evaluate t_2'',s''''$ then $t_2'=t_2''$ and $s'''=s''''$. This,
%   together with the \refrule{E-And} rule proves this case.\\
%
%   \noindent\textbf{Case} $\userule{S-Appoint}$ The \refrule{E-Appoint} rule
%   gives us that evaluation has been applied to $t$. We therefore can apply the
%   induction hypothesis, from which we obtain that $t',s'\evaluate t'',s''$ then
%   $t'=t''$ and $s'=s''$. This, together with the \refrule{E-Appoint} rule,
%   proves this case.

\subsection{\cref{thm:failing}}

\begin{proof}

  We prove \cref{thm:failing} by induction on $e'$.

\case{$e = \Fail$}
     {$\Failing(\Fail,s)=\True$, and there is no handling rule that applies to fail.}

\case{$e = \Edit v$}
     {$\Gamma,\Sigma\infers\Edit v:\Task\tau$, $\Failing(\Edit v,s)=\False$, and there exists an input $i$, namely $v':\tau$.}

\case{$e = \Enter \tau$}
     {$\Failing(\Enter \tau)=\False$, and there exists an in put i, namely $v:\tau$.}

\case{$e = \Update l$}
     {Given that $\Gamma,\Sigma\infers\Update l:\Task\tau$, $\Failing(\Update l,s)=\False$, and there exists an input $i$, namely $v:\tau$.}

\case{$e = t_1\Then e_2$}
     {$\Failing(t_1\Then e_2,s)=\Failing(t_1,s)$.
     If there exists an $i$ for $t_1$, then this $i$ also applies to $t_1\Then e_2$.
     This case therefore holds by the induction hypothesis.}

\case{$e = t_1\Next e_2$}
     {$\Failing(t_1\Next e_2,s)=\Failing(t_1,s)$.
     If there exists an $i$ for $t_1$, then this $i$ also applies to $t_1\Next e_2$.
     This case therefore holds by the induction hypothesis.}

\case{$e = e_1\Xor e_2$}
     {We normalise the two expressions first, $e_1,s\stride t_1,s'$, $e_2,s\stride t_2,s'$ and we can then be in two situations.
     One, we can have that $\Failing(t_1,s')$ and $\Failing(t_2,s')$ are both true.
     If that is so, then by definition, we have both $\Failing(e_1\Xor e_2,s)$ and no rule of the handling semantics applies, and therefore there exists no input for this case.

     Or we are in the situation where one or both of the two sub expressions does not fail.
     In that case, we know that $\Failing(e_1\Xor e_2,s)$ does not hold, and that at least one of the handling rules applies.
     Therefore, there must be an input $i$, namely $\Left$, $\Right$ or both.}

\case{$e = t_1\And t_2$}
     {We can again find ourselves in one of two situations.
     In the first case, both sub expressions fail, $\Failing(t_1,s)$ and $\Failing(t_2,s)$.
     In that case, we know that $\Failing(t_1\And t_2,s)$ also fails by definition.
     By the induction hypothesis, we know that for both $t_1$ and $t_2$ there is no input that can be handled.
     Since the only two rules for $\And$ that handle input just pass this input on to one of the two expressions, we know that indeed no $i$ applies.

     In the case that one or both sub expressions do not fail, then by definition $t_1\And t_2$ not failing under $s$.
     Again by induction hypothesis, we know that for one or both of the expressions, there exits an $i$ that can be handled.
     Then by H-FirstAnd and H-SecondAnd, we know that we can pass this $i$, by prefixing it with either $\First$ or $\Second$.}

\case{$e = t_1\Or t_2$}
     {We can again find ourselves in one of two situations.
     In the first case, both sub expressions fail, $\Failing(t_1,s)$ and $\Failing(t_2,s)$.
     In that case, we know that $\Failing(t_1\Or t_2,s)$ also fails by definition.
     By the induction hypothesis, we know that for both $t_1$ and $t_2$ there is no input that can be handled.
     Since the only two rules for $\Or$ that handle input just pass this input on to one of the two expressions, we know that indeed no $i$ applies.

     In the case that one or both sub expressions do not fail, then by definition $t_1\Or t_2$ not failing under $s$.
     Again by induction hypothesis, we know that for one or both of the expressions, there exits an $i$ that can be handled.
     Then by H-FirstOr and H-SecondOr, we know that we can pass this $i$, by prefixing it with either $\First$ or $\Second$.}

  % \noindent\textbf{Case} $e = u \At t$
  %  This case follows directly from applying the induction hypothesis, since $\Failing(u \At t,s)=\Failing(t,s)$ and any input that applies to $t$ also applies to $u \At t$.

       If the H-Next rule applies, this means that the conditions $\Value{(t_1,s)} = v_1 \wedge \neg\Failing{(e_2 v_1,s\stride)}$ are fulfilled, and therefore $\Continue$ is contained.}
