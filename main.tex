\title{Simple semantics for tasks}
\author{Tim Steenvoorden}

\maketitle

In this document we investigate a language to model interactive workflows using \emph{tasks}.
It is an (informal) introduction explaining design choices and giving examples on the way.
By using five basic constructs,
each with its own characteristics,
we will show how to express task based systems.
The author claims this language is capable of expressing the majority of programs that can be written using the \ITASKS framework \cite{conf/pepm/PlasmeijerAKLNG11}.
