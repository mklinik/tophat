-- Draft for a deep embedding of simple tasks. Tasks are syntax trees. There
-- are two semantics, the evaluation semantics and the user interface
-- semantics. No stable/unstable values yet. Therefore ParOr is not possible.

-- If we follow the principle of deep embedding strictly, then all semantics
-- should be separated. There are three different semantics: The step
-- semantics, the value semantics and the ui semantics. They come as separate
-- functions which _interpret_ tasks.
--
--   Task -> Value
--   Task -> UI
--   Task -> Event -> Task
--
-- In a shallow embedding, all semantics are combined into one data type, which
-- _is_ the task. The type must be recursive.
--
--   data Task = Task (Value, UI, Event -> Task)
--
-- Note how the arrow of the step semantics is inside the tuple.
--
-- Bas says: the real iTasks implementation is neither deep nor shallow, it
-- uses a different technique. Tasks never change, they never rewrite. Task
-- is not the same as the AST of a deep embedding.
-- iTasks is shallow-ish in the sense that the arrow _is_ the task.
--
--   :: Task = Task (Event TaskTree -> (Value, TaskTree))
--
-- All tasks are interpreters of their TaskTree. The structure of a whole
-- workflow is fixed. It re-routes events as steps are being taken.
