- http://conal.net/papers/frp.html
- The original paper seems to be "Functional Reactive Animation"
  http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/
- Elliott's latest paper "Push-pull functional reactive programming" is about
  efficient implementation of FRP, but also has a short introduction to FRP

- There is a book about FRP
  https://www.manning.com/books/functional-reactive-programming
  The introduction chapter is available online
